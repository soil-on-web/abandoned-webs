# abandoned-webs

a listing of abandoned websites on soil/land

are you following a link from an ancient report to a non existing website? Create an [issue](../../issues) or [pull request](../../pulls)

aim of this repo is to set up a list of abandoned websites related to land & soil information, on one hand to notify upcoming initiatives to consider url persistence, on the other hand to recover the lost information from repositories such as [archive.org](https://web.archive.org). If funding permits, it would be nice to reclaim the lost domains.

## Good practices on url persistence of project websites

- use a subdomain of an established organisation (prevents hijacking of the domain at domain expiration, indicates project ownership)
- use a persistent identifier framework, such as DOI, W3ID when linking to external sources
- set up [rewrite rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine) at website cancelation
- use minimal technology, yes: `html`; no: ~~php, wordpress, drupal, databases~~. we love [Static Site Generators](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/04/18/comparing-static-site-generators/], especially [quarto](https://quarto.org)
- if you adopt a domain anyway, keep the content minimal, set up a [one page website](https://www.web.com/blog/one-page-vs-multi-page-website/), from there link to external (persistent) resources and pre-pay the domain ownership (not the hosting) for at least the upcoming 10 years
